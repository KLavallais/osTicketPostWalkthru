## **Summary**

In this video, I walk you through the **post-installation** process of **osTicket**. After having set up **agents**, **users**, **teams**, **groups**, and **permissions**, the next step is to actually handle and manage tickets that are submitted to the system. You will see examples of ticket assignment, SLA categorization, and ticket resolution for various issues. This video builds on my previous video on the installation of osTicket and shows how to manage the helpdesk system in real-time.
